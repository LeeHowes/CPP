<h1>Continuations and std::future</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the Concurrency TS, <code>std::future</code> was augmented with support for continuations. However, the feedback leading up to and during the recent meeting in Toronto was that the specification for continuation support in the TS was insufficient. The absence of support for executors made it hard to control. LWG2533 expressed concern about where the continuation is run, and other papers including P0667, P0679 and P0701 expressed concerns with various parts of the proposal. Much of this
feedback relates to the ongoing work on executors that is as yet incomplete. The continuation elements of the Concurrency TS were subsequently not merged into the C++20 standard draft at Toronto.

<p>At Facebook we, like mamy companies, have considerable experience of using continuations on futures. Our folly library is widely used within the company, and is open source. Folly supports executors and continuations. From the widespread use of folly inside Facebook we have learned many lessons. One of the big lessons is very similar to that expressed in LWG2533: that it needs to be very well defined precisely where a continuation will run when applied to a Future. In the absence of a very
strong rule, there is an inherent non-determinism: I
<ul>
    <li>If the future is complete at the time of adding the continuation, will it run in the calling thread of execution?</li>
    <li>If the future is incomplete at the time of adding the continuation, is it possible for it to complete in the same thread of execution that completes the preceding task?</li>
    <li>Will the continuation always run in a well-defined thread-of-execution, whatever the completion state is of the future? To achieve this, the thread of execution has to be guaranteed to survive long enough to make this possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our experience leads us to believe that an executor should always be available to any attempt to add a continuation to a future, and where the continuation runs should be explicitly defined by the rules of that executor. In this way everything is clean as long as the lifetime of the executor can be guaranteed (which is out of scope of this paper).

<p>Always requiring specification of an executor is possible, but clumsy. During discussions in Toronto more than one person expressed a wish to allow a default executor, that would be used if none was provided to the call to <code>.then</code>. If this is allowed then we have further questions:
<ul>
    <li>Should the default executor be a global default. This will be suboptimal for cases where it makes more sense to allow the continuation task to run on same thread-of-execution as task that results in the future's result.</li>
    <li>Should an executor be embedded in the future, and hence a continuation added with <code>.then</code> would run on the same thread-of-execution as the future completes on? This would work well in many situations, but for libraries to safely return a future that did not allow the caller to run work on the library's internal threads-of-execution this might mean modifying the executor attached to the returned future before returning said future</li>
</ul>

<p>The second option here is often used in Facebook's libraries. The result is that asynchronous libraries will require an executor to be passed into the library, so that the library can attach that continuation to the future before returning it to provide the clean execution boundary required. The cost of this is that executor parameters need to be widespread and intrude in places where they are not relevant.

<p>Take a simple example of a library that gets a future and passes it into some other library:
<pre>
void myForwardingFunction() {
    Executor e;
    auto future = LibraryA::getFromSomewhere(&amp;e, params);
    LibraryB::sendToSomewhere(future);
}
</pre>

<p>In this case, why did <code>myForwardingFunction</code> need to know about an executor at all? How would we ever choose a reasonable excecutor here that guarantees forward progress and yet does not impose a high cost? In practice, <code>LibraryB</code> should use its own exector to run the continuation, but this is not something that <code>LibraryA</code> can rely on while providing a safe separation of concerns.

<p>A final reason for being concerned about executor guarantees is to ensure that in any inter-library interaction cases both the caller and callee can protect themselves from having the other's work run on their threads. An IO library may not want the caller to enqueue work on the IO thread pool, at the risk of starving IO of threads to service incoming requests; in this situation that library may have to attach a temporary executor, possibly on yet another thread, to safely bound the
interaction. On the other hand a function that is running work on an inline executor may want to ensure that the library it is passing a future to will definitely not run whatever work it has to do on the caller's thread - so again the caller may have to create an executor on a new thread just in case. In either case this extra thread adds cost, even if it never runs tasks, and the additional executors should be unnecessary with well-behaved code.

<h2>A simpler addition to std::future</h2>
We propose continuing to treat <code>std::future</code> as the vocabulary type for potentially asynchronous execution. We should not require that <code>std::future</code> make available a default executor and try to minimise the set of cases where it is not clear on what executor work will run.

<p>Instead, we propose modifying std::future to add a <code>.via()</code> method that takes an executor. <code>std::future::via</code> should consume the <code>std::future</code> and return a new future type, yet to be defined but that can be roughly similar to <code>std::experimental::future</code>, that adds support for continuations using <code>.then</code> methods. We will call this <code>ThennableFuture</code> here to avoid bikeshedding. <code>ThennableFuture</code> should store its executor internally, which means that it is well-defined to add an overload of <code>.then</code> that takes no executor. It may
even make sense to remove the <code>.then</code> overloads that do take executors to make it absolutely explicit that at any point in the code, continuations are enqueued on the executor contained within the future and to remove potential confusion over whether <code>.then(executor, task)</code> has sticky behaviour, such that the future is now bound to <code>executor</code> or non-sticky behaviour such that the future's executor returns to its original value. It is open to discussion
whether this method should be restricted to r-value references. We additionally add a conversion, possibly implicit, from thenable_future to <code>std::future</code>. 

<p>Therefore we might aim for something similar to:

<pre>
template&lt;class T&gt;
class future {
    ...
    // Primary r-value via method
    template&lt;class ExecutorT&gt;
    std::thenable_future&lt;T&gt; via(ExecutorT executor) &amp;&amp;;
    // Optional l-value via method
    template&lt;class ExecutorT&gt;
    std::thenable_future&lt;T&gt; via(ExecutorT executor) const &amp;;
};

template&lt;class T&gt;
class thenable_future{
    ...
    // Implicit conversion to std::future
    operator std::future<T>() &amp;&amp;;
    // r-value executor-less addition of continuation and return new future
    template&lt;class FunctionT&gt;
    thenable_future&lt;T&gt; then(FunctionT task) &amp;&amp;;

    // Optional r-value then operation with executor and l-value then operations
    template&lt;class ExecutorT, class FunctionT&gt;
    thenable_future&lt;T&gt; then(FunctionT task) const &amp;;
    template&lt;class ExecutorT, class FunctionT&gt;
    thenable_future&lt;T&gt; then(ExecutorT executor, FunctionT task) const &amp;;
    template&lt;class ExecutorT, class FunctionT&gt;
    thenable_future&lt;T&gt; then(ExecutorT executor, FunctionT task) &amp;&amp;;
};
</pre>


<p>In this world, <code>std::future</code> stays as the vocabulary type, with general day to day use unchanged. Our forwarding function as described above simplifies:

<pre>
void myForwardingFunction() {
    auto future = LibraryA::getFromSomewhere(params);
    LibraryB::sendToSomewhere(future);
}
</pre>

<p>We no longer need to tell <code>LibraryA</code> what executor to return us a future on, which means that <code>myForwardingFunction</code> now does not need to know about executors at all. Why should it care? <code>LibraryA</code> did some work, <code>LibraryB</code> will do some more work dependent on <code>LibraryA</code>'s work. The forwarder need not know what that is, and in addition need not incur any extra cost of adding a shunt-type executor that exists purely to protect
<code>LibraryA</code> from its callers.

<p>As <code>std::future</code> will be carrying potentially unexecuted tasks, to allow safe chaining it may be necessary to include a type-erased executor as a field in the future core, but this appears to be an implementation detail. It is probably also safe to share the same core, with continuation support, between <code>std::future</code> and <code>std::thenable_future</code> making the required set of conversion operations low-to-zero cost. This is certainly how we have implemented it in
Folly.



<h2>Templating the new future</h2>
If we continue to use <code>std::future</code> as the vocabulary type for APIs, we can consider templating our new future on the executor type for efficiency. So our new future then becomes typed:

<pre>
template&lt;class T, class ExecutorT&gt; class thenable_future;
</pre>

<p>What is interesting about this is that it means we do not pass a future that supports continuations and yet has an unknown executor across library boundaries. This is important because it also means we do not pass a future that supports continuations and has an unknown forward progress guarantee for those continuations.

<p>We can discuss with proposals to replace <code>std::experimental::future</code> whether this has value, but we believe that by separating the two types rather than attempting to drastically widen the interface of <code>std::future</code> we have the option.


<h2>Boost blocking and deferred execution</h2>
During the Toronto meeting, Torvald expressed a desire to ensure that continuations and result extraction for futures provide boost-blocking guarantees. folly::future and its executors do not provide this: we require a call to getVia to ensure that a callback that has no currently known executor gets one, and chains of continuations with undriven executors will not execute.

<p>We do see a common case, however, where a library wants to do some work on its own executor, and some on some provided executor. For example, much of Facebook's networking code will deserialize on a provided executor. The above code where we need to pass an executor to the library call is an example of this, and it causes problems in practice from users finding libraries hard to learn, to the addition of additional shunt executors and threads just to chain calls together.

<p>With good boost-blocking support we can avoid this. The proposal is that <code>.get</code> boost-blocks the executor attached to the future. <code>.via</code> similarly boost blocks, but it does it by ensuring that a task is added to the provided future that drives the previously attached future. In this way a whole chain of inline executors may be provided that drive each other in turn until the work is completed.

<p>Assuming we have some deferred executor type that guarantees not to execute work immediately but to run it when the executor is driven later (ie inline but with an <code>execute</code> method that calls <code>post</code. or <code>defer</code>). This means code like the following can be made to work:
<pre>
std::future&lt;ResultType&gt; LibraryA::getFromSomewhere(ParamType params) {
    std::ThennableFuture tf = getRawNetworkData(params);
    return tf.via(DeferredExecutor{}).then([](auto&amp; serializedData){ return deserialize(serializedData); });
}

int main() {
    auto f = getFromSomewhere(ParamType{});
    // Deserialization will happen some time after this point, on ThreadedExecutor
    auto resultFuture = f.via(ThreadedExecutor{});
    ...
    return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>This gives us control of what runs where, but with a simple API for interacting between libraries.

<code>.then</code> need not boost-block here, as that behaviour is a property of the executors, and any application of boost-blocking is thus defined by points at which executors are connected together - with the clarification that a call to <code>f.get()</code> is logically equivalent to <code>InlineExecutor e; auto f2 = f.via(e); e.drive(); f2.get();</code> 

<p>Boost-blocking of executors still has to be considered carefully, of course, to avoid recursive driving behaviour. We merely use a <code>drive()</code> method as a potential interface for this that internals of futures would use.

<p>TODO: How about passing the current executor into the continuation? Maybe optionally. That way state abotu the current execution (TLS, the current thread, thread ids etc that might make sense for GPUs and so on) can be available though the executor or some sort of executor context parameter.

<h2>Forward progress guarantees</h2>
TODO: Any executor on a std;:future should be at minimum boost-blocking because the library the work is passed to will have no way to enforce progress otherwise.
